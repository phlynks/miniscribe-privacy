# Privacy Policy for MiniScribe

Last updated: September 3, 2025

## Introduction

The Unpainted Hoard ("we," "our," or "us") operates the MiniScribe mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains what information the App accesses or processes, how it is used, and what choices you have. The App is designed to work fully offline by default; cloud backup to your own Google Drive is optional and user-initiated.

## Information We Access or Process

We strive to minimize data collection and do not operate any backend servers. The App primarily stores data locally on your device. When you enable certain features, the App may access or process the following information:

### 1) Google Account Information (when you sign in)
- Email address associated with your Google account (used to authenticate with Google Drive and to enable optional features such as promo entitlement checks).
- Google Sign-In is used solely for authenticating you with Google APIs (no social features).

### 2) Google Drive Backup (optional)
If you enable backup to Google Drive, the App will upload and access files in your Google Drive using the limited scope `drive.file`:
- A structured backup of your app data (e.g., miniatures, paints, projects, preferences) as JSON and related assets.
- Images you choose to back up (e.g., progress photos, recipe images). Images may be compressed to reduce size.
- The App creates and operates within its own folder in your Drive and does not request full Drive access.
- Only you (through your Google account) have access to your Drive backups. We do not have access to your Drive.

### 3) Purchases (Google Play Billing)
- Purchase status for the one-time product `full_license`.
- Google Play purchase token may be stored locally on your device to maintain your entitlement.
- No payment information is accessed by the App; purchases are handled by Google Play.

### 4) Local App Data (stored on your device)
- Your collection data (miniatures, paints, projects, statistics, notes).
- Images you capture or select in the App.
- App preferences (e.g., backup settings, saved searches, license status).

### We do NOT collect
- Analytics events or advertising identifiers.
- Crash reports sent to us. (Android/Google Play may collect aggregated diagnostics separately under their policies.)
- Your data on any server controlled by us.

## How We Use Information
- To provide core App functionality (cataloging, images, settings) locally on your device.
- To perform optional backups and restores to your own Google Drive when you enable the feature.
- To determine license status (e.g., unlock features after a successful Google Play purchase or promo entitlement).
- To improve reliability and user experience on-device. No server-side profiling or marketing is performed.

## Data Sharing and Transfers
- We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties.
- Data transmitted to Google (for Sign-In, Drive, and Play Billing) is handled under Google’s policies and occurs only to deliver the features you enable.

## Data Security
- Your primary data is stored locally on your device.
- Communication with Google APIs uses HTTPS.
- Backups in Google Drive are stored in your own account under Google’s security controls.

## Data Retention and Deletion
- Local data remains on your device until you delete it, clear app data, or uninstall the App.
- Google Drive backups remain in your Drive until you delete them.
- Purchase status is tied to your Google account and managed by Google Play; a local token may be cached on your device for entitlement.

## Your Choices and Rights
- Use the App without signing in; backup is optional.
- Enable/disable Google Drive backup anytime in Settings.
- Delete local data by clearing app data or uninstalling.
- Delete cloud backups directly from your Google Drive.
- Change Google permissions in your Google account settings.

## Permissions Used
- Camera: to capture photos for your collection (optional).
- Photos/Media (READ_MEDIA_IMAGES on supported Android versions): to import images you select.
- Internet and network state: required for Google Sign-In, Google Drive backup/restore, and Google Play Billing.

## Third-Party Services
- Google Sign-In (Identity): https://policies.google.com/privacy
- Google Drive API: https://policies.google.com/privacy
- Google Play and Play Billing: https://policies.google.com/privacy
- Android/Google Play may provide aggregated diagnostics under their own policies.

## Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. Updates will be posted in the App and the date at the top will be revised.
